     <h2>NECK WORKOUT</h2>
     <div>
      <b>Neck Bridges</b><br>
      <p>Neck bridges are performed by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, then lifting your hips and rolling onto the top of your head while supporting your body weight through your neck and feet, maintaining balance and tension through the neck muscles, and holding the position briefly before lowering back down. They primarily target the neck extensors, traps, and upper back, while also engaging the glutes and core for support. The benefits include strengthening the neck for better injury resistance, improving posture and spinal stability, and enhancing performance in sports or activities that demand strong neck and upper back muscles.</p><br>
