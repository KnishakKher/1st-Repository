     <h2>FOREARMS WORKOUT</h2>
     <div>
      <b>Dead Hang</b><br>
      <p>A dead hang is performed by gripping a pull-up bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width, palms facing away or toward you, and allowing your body to hang freely with arms fully extended and shoulders engaged (not relaxed completely), keeping your core tight and legs slightly in front for balance. It primarily targets the forearms, grip, shoulders, and upper back muscles, while also engaging the core for stability. The benefits include improving grip strength, decompressing the spine, enhancing shoulder mobility and joint health, and building endurance and stability for exercises like pull-ups and muscle-ups.</p><br>
