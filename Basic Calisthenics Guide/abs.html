     <h2>ABS WORKOUT</h2>
     <p><b>Every calisthenics workout is an abs workout in disguise if done right as each one of those requires our core to be engaged.Still if an ab workout is required , one effective one is more than enough to do the job.</b></p>

      <b>The Hollow Body Hold</b><br>
      <p>The hollow body hold is performed by lying flat on your back, engaging your core to press your lower back into the floor, then lifting your legs a few inches off the ground while simultaneously raising your head, shoulders, and arms so your body forms a slight curve or “hollow” shape. It primarily targets the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and hip flexors, while also engaging the lower back and quads for stability. The benefits include improving core strength and endurance, enhancing body control and balance, and building a solid foundation for calisthenics movements like handstands and levers.</p><br>
